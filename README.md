## About the project.
* This project is aimed at giving a glimpse of my web-development abilities to potential employers and/or clients. I made the design on this project very simple and concise but yet compelling anyone that sees it to want to see more of my projects.

    I started out by sketching my intended design on a notepad and adding all the major components and the correct tags to use.

    I built this web page using bootstrap grid layout and got most of the components on the page from bootstrap; this reduced the styling work I had to do greatly.

    This project is a revision of my previous portfolio project. I decided to update and polish my portfolio to make it more appealing.
